After the demo class I was very sure about joining EDGE. I took up both dot net and Sql server course.The price was reasonable.\r\nThe trainer was very Intelligent and well informed. EDGE has very good lab facilities and practical sessions. The concepts are explained very nicely in simple words and with good examples.

Very friendly and a good mentor to understand and provide roadmap to solve my problem/ requirement.  He was very flexible, trained me on topics focused on solution rather than a full fledged structured training. That helped me and saved a lot of time and efforts.

For last 4 attempts I was appearing for CA final for both the groups after taking coaching classes from a big academy in Bangalore. Even after all my efforts I was not able to clear the exam, either failing in individual papers or in aggregate.\r\n\r\nSomeone told me that Rohit Sir takes personal tuition for CA final. I thought let me make the last attempt with personal tuition, if that can make the difference. Initially I had the doubt as what can be taught over Skype, but then I enrolled for his personal Skype class for the Nov? 14 session as I didn?t find any other way by which I can have personal focus from the teacher.\r\n\r\nI took classes for all practical papers namely, Financial Reporting, SFM, Direct taxes, Costing and Indirect taxes. It took me 1-2 classes to adjust and thereafter it was very smooth and interesting. At the 1st class of every paper, he gauged my level and then accordingly tailored it to suit my needs.\r\n\r\nHis expertise is unmatched. The way he deals with the Accounting Standards and the way he connects the AS with Income tax and Company Law is exemplary. AS never looked so easy to me, earlier. If you have solid grip over AS then we all know that half the battle is won. His notes for the FR incl. AS are superb. \r\n\r\nHis command over direct taxes and the way he teaches must be appreciated. Direct taxes which is another very tough paper for final was appealing to me after taking sir?s class. He starts from the toughest portion of paper which is Assessment and connected things. Again, His notes are highly exam oriented.\r\n\r\nHis notes for Strategic FM are awesome. He comprehensively deals with CAPM, Capital Budgeting and rationing. I never had any problem in dealing with practical paper like this, through Skype. I simply love the varied examples that he gives from real life. He made this paper very exciting.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise he even had the same depth of knowledge even for indirect taxes and Costing. Although I had not taken classes for audit and company law but he guided me on the way to approach these papers.\r\n\r\nI sincerely thank Rohit Sir from the core of my heart as I cleared both the groups of CA final after taking his classes.\r\n\r\nHe is a wonderful person and someone who really inspires you to do your best. My experience was phenomenal and I highly recommend him for CA final.

After you join, you will be asked to come for their staff available timing.If you are working professional may be you have been asked to resign your job and do the course.Dont get surprised.\r\n\r\nNot equipped well.Shortage of systems.\r\n\r\nThink 100 times before you join..\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

It was about my career, so I was not ready to take chance. Before Logicblend, I attended a demo class at 5 various training centers with not so good experience. Everywhere I attended the demo, I saw the trainers were not very good in presenting, neither they were confident. When I had the demo with Logicblend, I was very glad and found this was the place I was looking for. There is not only one trainer, but there will be 2 trainers and sometimes 3 trainers in every session. Everyone highly experienced and he number of students are limited thus the attension to each individual is great. The quality of the training is exceptionally well, the knowledge all the trainers posses is highly appriciable. It was a joy learning Performance Testing from them and after the course I was so confident that I will clear the interviews... as said, I attended interviews at 2 companies and I cleared both...

The most effective way to make mathematics enjoyable is to create a community in which students feel comfortable.  I begin with an ""anticipatory set"" by motivating my lectures through a series of examples, then I present definitions and theorems by providing equations and diagrams, as every student has a different learning style.  Some students grasp theory quickly while others require concrete examples and some feel comfortable by visual explanations and requires pictures.  I try to keep all of this in mind during lecturing.  In teaching I strive to convey my enthusiasm for the subject, clearly articulate the material and probe the connections between the new concepts and background knowledge.  My students want to arrive at the ""right answer"", while I want to emphasize though process required to arrive at the answer.  I encourage group work by the students with the worksheets after the completion of each chapter which is beneficial to both the strong students and those who are struggling.

I must now say it was a really good decision. The tutors who taught us were, i must say very good at what they do. One of the best parts is where they encourage you to ask questions always and they take the time to make sure you understand it. Plus you have daily homework which really helps you to implement whatever your taught in class.They also have a web portal where you can revise whatever is taught in class again.\r\n\r\nI think for all newbies and beginners who want to start of in analytic this place provides a good platform mainly due to the good faculty.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahul Verma\n\n attended \n\n posted on 21 May, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""These Days most of the companies are moving towards Data based Decision making.The sector like Retail , Finance , Pharma they are using data analysis in their process for better understanding and decision making.

One specific comment was about finding an inspiring relationship where we both make each other higher.\r\nReiki has instilled a renewed faith in our universe for me.

I had to agree for this to adjust my dates, one-to-one session and they quoted more items compared to other IBCA institute(when specifically asked). I had also mentioned I was a beginner.\r\n\r\nIBCA institute offers the same items in Egg-free baking but for just 5k. \r\nBut they offer only on week days and as per their calendar schedules.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n\r\nFirst day: Breads and bread rolls (Good)\r\nI could knead the dough and learn some roll knots, butter/milk washing, basic flavouring(garlic, rosemary+raisin breads).\r\nWhat was expected more? Some explanation about how yeast/baking powder/soda affect bread/cake rising. What actions/ingredients make bad breads? (IBCA mentions this in their course)\r\n\r\nSecond day: Apple pie, Lemon tart, fruit lolly pop and Tea cake\r\nI made the pastry/batter for all these. The chefs also mention some tips/tricks. But there is a lot of tricks in the temperatures in different OTGs/Convection ovens. The chef knows his OTG and could make the tea cake well. When tried at home, the cake sank in the middle(in my oven).\r\n\r\nThird day: Sponge cake, Chocochip cookies, Vanilla/Chocolate(black forest) cake, cup cakes, Basic decorations\r\nThese are the important things for me. But all these were a flop. This day I was allowed just to measure and fold. All the cakes sank in the middle, became hard and tasted burnt. So I could never understand how to avoid an egg-free cake from falling in the mid. The cookie was soggy even after cooling. About decoration, the cakes were adjusted with pieces for learning layering (1-2 layers reduced cake was not spongy and fell). However I could understand some basic decoration.\r\n\r\nSo, I had to still rely on google and my experimentation to understand what can be made to avoid falling.\r\nThey don\'t give the certificate soon after the course is over. They claimed they resent twice, but I never received. I couldn\'t believe they even sent it. This was the first time someone had to resend to my office address. Finally my wife collected it personally.\r\n\r\nOverall feedback: \r\n1. The chefs were patient enough to answer my questions. \r\n2. This course is not even worth 5k. The items taught are less compared to IBCA. The admin claimed it is too high because of one-to-one teaching and ingredients would be more. For these reasons, one can pay 1-2k more but not more than double. I can recommend this course if the price is appropriate and all the items they claim to teach come out well at least in their presence (at least the important ones).""', u'M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMamtha Rao\n\n attended \n25 Hrs Culinary Certification Program in Bakery & Confectionery\n on 20 Apr, 2013\n posted on 21 Apr, 2013\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""The trainer was patient and he taught me really well ""']"

The academy actively promotes various forms of classical and semi-classical music like bandish, bhajan, tarana, thumri, khayal, just to name a few. This school follows the true tradition of Guru-Shishya parampara. It has a consistent standard of teaching, thereby inculcating technical finesse and discipline among its students. Also, it?s a good thing that the school does not adhere to a particular gharana (In Hindustani music, each gharana represents a distinct style). The best from each gharana is chosen and taught to us.\r\nAll the teachers at the school have a laid back approach and allow the student to progress at his or her own pace. Teaching styles are very unique and comfortable. Lessons are revised time and again till each and every student gets the hang of it.

Firstly, the concepts he grasped at Mathematics Hothouse helped him handling the 10th board exam with ease. Thereafter, he scored 17th rank in the annual Mathematics Olympiad conducted by Department of Mathematics at IIT Bombay. He could successfully clear Regional Mathematics Olympiad in 2013 because of the rigorous coaching he got under the guidance of Mr. Nalin Pithwa of Mathematics Hothouse. \r\nThe concepts are taught at Mathematics Hothouse in a very simplistic way which makes the student comfortable and confident at the same time. The practice questions are of equally high level which ensures that the student remembers what he has learnt in the class. \r\nMy son is currently in 12th standard and aspiring to clear IIT examinations to be held in 2015.

I approach tutoring in such a way that I show the students the basics, and then give them a variety of practice exercises and urge them figure out the answers themselves. If in doubt, I would keep prompting them to find the right answers thereby helping them to grasp the right concepts. .I believe in giving clear idea of concepts and rigorous practice to my students.

Gopu helped me with getting familiar with the DSLR first, the buttons and what are their use.then we learned the basic concepts of photography starting with Exposure, followed by Aperture, Shutter speed and ISO. then we looked at the different modes in the camera and how and when to shoot with them. we also dealt with few things to be done and not to be done while photographing a subject.\r\n\r\nThis was an amazing experience for me and i now know to click better pics,and as he rightly said this course was just the start and lot more needs to be done by practicing and gaining knowledge through other sources as well.

Good interaction with students and  out of box examples to soothe the requirements in the subject are my main strength in teaching.

On the first day of the class, we made the GEAR TRAIN . It was a train which was made of many GEAR \'s& it was running on a gear track.Next day we made a TANKER. Third day we made MARCHING ROBOT .And on the fourth day we made a catapult. This was the end of the Elementary Physics. ONn the next day we started to do many circuits including GRIP SCOPE LED Flasher,Hand steadynes cTester & many other circuits.THis was the end of the ELECTRONICS. From the next day we started the ROBOTICS . First we made EXPLORER, then RADAR& DOOR ALARM, and also 3-SPEED TRANSMISSION WITH CLUCTH.Finally on the last day we made CHECK OUT SCANNER, While doing the models & circuits we shared good time with our teachers & our friends.""']"

He has in-depth knowledge about the subject and his style of teaching is very simple and friendly. He taught me the subject based on my understanding capabilities but without any compromises. Apart from theoretical knowledge he showed a lot of practical & real time examples that helped me in better understanding of the subject. He was very patient with every question I had(I was a tough student). He clearly defines on what one should learn that helps your carrier. Lastly and most importantly he always encouraged me and removed all negative and self-doubts that I had about myself. Omkar is not only an excellent teacher but also a wonderful mentor.

This way I would pay less, he said. Silly me, I believed him! The result: I paid upfront for 12 months and I ended up enjoying only 6 months.The lady at the reception said if I wanted to continue using the gym, I had to renew my membership and pay again. She knew about the deal I had with the owner but she didn?t care,and the owner never replied to my phone calls nor emails. SHAME ON THEM!

We first started with 3kgs dumbbells, and within a month, my workout has upgraded to lifting 10kgs dumbbells. I could never have lifted 10kgs dumbbells at the start of the training.

It was a 2day workshop for myself. The training was very professional. Rahul knows how to make a layman understand what is it like taking beautiful shots. I am now practicing based on the tips he provided in the class. Believe it, I am much better in photography than I could Imagine.One advantage I found is he dedicates these two days to you and is very patient and encouraging. He doesn\'t fake about your photographs. He is very honest in providing his review on photo and helps us know what went wrong.  I would recommend Rahul to people who want to start photography from scratch.  Its really worth spending for his classes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

From the very beginning, they make sure to keep track of your progress and do whatever it takes to help you. Even if that means keeping the class open till 10 in the night. They stand by you at each and every step in your training. Yes, when it comes to ensuring your improvement, they are strict (which is good), but apart from that, they are really nice people.

He has an awesome knowledge of machine and assembly languages, in my opinion he is the best C++ teacher i have seen. Along with this he has a superb command over metasploit framework. The quality he shown while teaching was world-class.\r\nHis dedication can be seen in every field, whether it is teaching, studying or working. The way he deals with everything is flawless and fluent, and it\'s very like a miracle to see all these things in a person at this young age.\r\nIt was a great experience of learning hacking from him @innobuzz knowledge solution pvt.ltd.

His approach towards the problem will always be a holistic way. He gives more importance for the fundamentals concepts.He will repeat the concept until we understand it.

I come with no programming background in VBA and also with several apprehensions about tutors. He not only taught me tricks in using Excel as a normal user or analyst, but also he taught me enough to achieve at my job using VBA. I was able to complete one of the very difficult tasks at work, which several expert programmers were hesitant to take up and crack. Sessions with Mahesh sir, truly helped me think about MS Excel and VBA quite differently, which would not have been possible otherwise with just online videos or books.  Also one good thing about him is he keeps timeline of learning very flexible and also repeating things I did not understand in first shot, which helped a lot. He was always serious about me learning - than he teaching or completing the course to put it in one word.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuresh Bezawada\n\n attended \n\n in Apr,2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 09 Aug, 2015\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I attended online training with him (one on one) for PMP Prep (4 days).

TENT CINEMA,,Banashankari 2nd Stage,Bangalore,India,560070,"Acting becomes an organic process of describing the world, and of relating to it an extremely authentic and physical manner. A group of students asked to describe a cup of coffee, for example, initially tried shaping themselves in the form of a glass. Going back to it again, they realized the idea was conveyed more subtly and easily by simply miming holding a hot cup, taking a sip, and placing it on an imaginary table.The exercises in class encourage students to think of themselves as artists by being open and transparent to the world around them. This is achieved by first breaking the often-imperceptible walls people have created within themselves. In one such exercise, the teacher steps out of the class and the students are asked to make as much noise as they can. Their aim must be to scream, shout, yell, laugh, and stomp around so loud it could bring the roof down! People are always expected to be quiet and maintain a certain amount of decorum. This exercise helps them breaks those expectations and allows them to be free.","['https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46860-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46861-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46862-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46863-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46864-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46865-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46866-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46867-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/46868-large.jpg', '/bangalore/tent-cinema-banashankari-2nd-stage/gallery/5009822']","['Acting\n                           \n                               classes', 'Photography\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Summer Camp\n                           \n                               classes', 'Art and Craft\n                           \n                               classes', 'Video Editing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Etiquette Training for Children\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Film Making\n                           \n                               classes', 'Film Editing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Film Direction\n                           \n                               classes', 'Script Writing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Action Script\n                           \n                               Training', 'Digital Film Making\n                           \n                               classes', 'Kids Photographers', 'Fashion Photographers', 'Family Photographers']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/1398998-medium190ap.png,"[u'S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShivaranjan S Patil\n\n attended \n\n in Aug,2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 17 Feb, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I am very happy to say that I am a student of Tent Cinema.

Bornfree Art School,,Jayanagar 3rd Block,Bangalore,India,560011,"There are 217 million working children in the world, 134 million of which live and word in India. These children toil for adults' profits and are deprived of the fundamental human right to education. Working children have no homes and attend no schools; they instead roam the streets and sleep under the stars. They belong to the most oppressed section of the society. In India, child labour is prohibited under the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child as well as the domestic law entitled the Child Labour Prohibition Act, 1986. However, child labour is socially, politically, economically and culturally systemized and practiced all over India. We need to bring about a social and cultural change in the mindset of the people and create an ever-growing community committed to the cause of creating an egalitarian society free of toiling children. Until we take up the task of educating and empowering our children, changes in the social pattern will become a distant dream. It is through the expressive idiom of the plastic and visual arts; theater, dance, mime, song and music and dialogue",[],['Acting\n                           \n                               classes'],https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/1608152-medium190ap.jpeg,[]
