Mr.Jeyamurugan\'s 3ds Max classes and Mr.R.K Karthikeyan\'s matchmoving, rigging and Maya classes laid a very strong foundation for me in VFX. MAAC Annanagar is frequently visited by Giants from our International VFX industry. During my VFX and compositing course here, MAAC Annanagar gave me the opportunity to meet and interact face to face with artists from PIXAR, ILM, Prana, just to name a few. MAAC Annanagar has an amazing Library of VFX books, its here that I actually got into the habit of reading.

During our course we start off with Analysis and Design using Object Oriented  methodologies.  We then start with a little introduction of data base theory and then into practical design. Basic concepts like normalization, Relationships are taught with real life examples. Then we move on to making Classes and Collections and all that which comes with them like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, etc. By the time you are finished with the complete course you will be able to make your  own line store.

The course was lead by him a well paced manner , where he gave focus on aspects were I was lacking, We moved to the next part only after gaining sufficient confidence in the current part. \r\n4.

I went through \r\na lot of institutes where they gave a fake job promises and an attracting discounts. Once I came to know about Mr Rupam Das and had a meeting \r\nwith him.  He clearing explained the about the course which covers the very basics (others would lure you by saying \r\nthey will teach you how  to make humanoid robot and even mars rovers ). So my friends and me joined the training program.\r\nThe training was completely practical. He thought everything from scratch and there were no pre written programs which he showed only \r\noutputs. He wrote every program during the training explaining the various error scenarios and by taking the case studies that happened\r\nin his experience. The assignments given by him are challenging as well. In embedded he started with assembly language and then with embedded C\r\nand went through every basics components of embedded. More than everything he taught us how to learn things which helped to go beyond the stretch of syllabus. He guided me in doing various projects even after the completion of course. With the knowledge I acquired over the training in landed up in a C programming job in prominent product development firm. Through this training you can crack any sort of programming interview,\r\nwith some efforts from your side .\r\n\r\nWish you good luck.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

After practicing kickboxing for 3 years I felt I needed an art that was tailored for self defence.In 2009 I was introduced to Wing Chun. I knew Bruce Lee had studied this art and I knew this had fast hands.I attended an introductory course with my friend Imran at sifu Shawn Rawcliffe\u2019s school. I was impressed with the art for being unique, fast and a counter attacking style. Being a close quarter range martial arts system I had decided to pursue a journey in Wing Chun.\r\nMyself and Imran had practiced the basics together over the years.It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that I had to relocate for work in Warrington. There I met and trained under Sifu Jay Hussein (Ching Mo Wing Chun school) for a few months gaining a good insight to wing chun.The systems simple and direct approach have left me fascinated. I really enjoy training the sensitivity drills and applications of trapping and locking. After moving back home to Leicester the most interesting part of my journey commenced. I was fortunate to get in contact with Sifu Abid and join his school. Training under him I have found that he teaches wing chun with a very practical approach to modern day fighting / self defence and he explains why certain techniques work in a certain manner.He is by far one of the most humble and most patient instructors I have come across. Sifu\u2019s teaching has always been demonstrated effectively.His multiple assailants drill has been a brilliant blood pumping exercise that simulates a real life scenario.\r\nIt has been a great privilege to learn from Sifu as he is very skilled and confident in what he teaches. Under his guidance I have seen an improvement in my technique and ability.Helping students in the class has been a rewarding experience especially when students progress in their ability and understanding of applications.\r\nMy desire is to gain an in depth understanding to the principals and theories of wing chun and be able to share that knowledge with other students.I look forward to learning and helping new students in the future.Most importantly I would like to thank sifu for teaching us with so much dedication.""', u'K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKashif Amin\n\n attended \n\n in Jun,2012\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 15 Mar, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""\u201cI have been training with Sifu Abid from the Midlands Wing Chun Association for the past few years, and cannot recommend him highly enough. Sifu Abid\u2019s classes are always disciplined, energetic and inspirational. Through the course of my training, I have grown in confidence in my own abilities and application of Wing Chun. His training has helped me to improve coordination, stamina, body strength, dexterity and endurance. Sifu Abid is very experienced and has the innate ability to tailor his lessons to people of all ages and backgrounds. This has been especially evident with my children (son aged 6yrs and daughter aged 8yrs), who regularly attend the children\u2019s sessions. They engage in the lessons with great energy and enthusiasm, supported by Sifu Abid\u2019s guidance and encouragement. Training with Sifu Abid has enabled us to appreciate the amazing depth and diversity of the Wing Chun Kung Fu martial art.\u201d\r\n""', u'I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImran Mukerdam\n\n attended \n\n in Sep,2013\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 15 Mar, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""Having practiced Karate at a young age, I was familiar with punching and kicking with flexibility, discipline and order.Later on in 2009 me and my friend Arif were introduced to Wing Chun.\r\nAfter attending an introductory course with Sifu Shaun Rawcliffe, we were impressed by its uniqueness and explosiveness. We practiced the basics together that we had learnt until 2014. During this time (2009 \u2013 2014) I would research with interest into the art of Wing Chun. The more I researched the more interested I became.\r\nDue to work commitments I never had the chance to dedicate my time to Wing Chun. I would read books and watch videos and try and train through these methods instead. My friend Arif had the opportunity to learn some Wing Chun in Warrington. We would meet on weekends and practice and improve what we knew.\r\nNow that we are fortunate and have met Sifu Abid, we have had the opportunity to learn so much from Sifu\u2019s teaching experience. Learning from someone very patient and skilled like Sifu has really progressed our Wing Chun in a couple months.\r\nIt is wonderful to see him demonstrate his knowledge every lesson and see how Wing Chun uses science and bio-mechanics instead of physical brute strength. Training under a well accomplished Sifu who is humble has really given me a far better understanding and grasp of the concept of Wing Chun.\r\nIt is Sifu Abid\u2019s teaching ability and experience that makes him an ideal teacher.\r\nI would definitely recommend Sifu Abid to anyone who wants to learn Wing Chun.""']"

I could no longer face the embarrassment, and the disappointment. Though heard about many medicines over net; was scared to intake those due to its known side effects. A great glimpse of miracle worked out in my life, when I came to know from other friends who had benefitted from Abdul\'s premature treatment. Frank enough, I never trusted Abdul\'s words when I conversed with him on the first day of treatment. As days passed, I felt tremendous changes in my organs during the course of treatment. On completion of the treatment, I felt that I was born again to live a life full of only joy and happiness. For me, it is a miracle God had done in my life through Abdul. I express my heartfelt thanks to Abdul for his sincere service towards his treatment and for having got back my precious life to live.""', u'R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald\n\n attended \n\n in Sep,2009\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 22 Mar, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""Knowing i was returning to Chennai, I searched the internet for Thai massage. I found Abdul\'s advertisement and mobile phone number in Chennai. His brand of Thai massage has been adapted from what you\'d find in Bangkok or Chang Mai. Familiar parts are there, but there is a greater emphasis on the pressure points he has found customers want. I\'ve also enjoyed the 2 hour deep tissue massage and look forward to having Reflexology which has been very favorably reviewed by the Hindu, the local paper with the biggest circulation. Each massage at AIMS will bear his personal stamp as he has trained all the masseurs. You\'ll find his staff to be quiet if you want to drift into dreamlike sleep or conversant if you prefer. Quiet works for me. If your stay is short you can incorporate the massage into a regimen of diet and exercise, your muscles and internal organs will thank you for taking good care of them.""', u'N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNina Reddy\n\n attended \n\n in Mar,2010\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 22 Mar, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""He is the man with the healing hands, I have had the massage Therapies around the world, but I feel that I am at the hands of the best Masseur, when Mr. Abdul is doing Massage for me.It is not only relaxing and rejuvenating, also one can feel certain warmth, which says he has got the hands of a Healer.

				Tamil",T Nagar,Chennai,India,600017,First I started teaching to my friend who needs some more attention in subjects and I helped him in his 12th exams. It helps him a lot and he succeeded in his board exams. So I got some motivation and from that I started teaching. He referred his friends and also i got a reference to an institution and from that institution i got referred to lot of clients for home tuition. From that its been 7 years i am teaching. I really got inspired from my teachers in school and from CA institute teachers. My school teachers always tell us how much they feel good being a teacher. They are my mentors for doing this job. It gives me more inner happiness. As Swami Vivekananda told a man's life is divided into 4 parts. 25% parents + 25% friends + 25% teachers + 25% our self.

I have actually learned some positive reinforcement techniques from watching them and have never once witnessed inappropriate negative interactions. These teachers are absolutely genuine. My son doesn`t transition well and they just kindly comfort him until he is calmed down. The few bad days my son has had they handle it in a way that lets me know my son is normal and all kids have bad days and have to work on growing and developing. I appreciate not being made to feel like there is a big problem. I was also pleased with how well they understood my son during conferences.

More than half had at least one artistic vocation, and almost all had an enduring hobby, from chess to insect collecting. One-quarter of the Nobel laureates were musicians, and 18 percent practiced visual arts such as drawing or painting. Hobbies and imagination help foster professional breakthroughs as well. Your children may or may not unlock the origins of the universe, but through GHS you give them an opportunity to see the world in a different way.","['https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/67772-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70143-large.jpeg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70144-large.jpeg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70145-large.jpeg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70146-large.jpeg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70147-large.jpeg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70270-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/70271-large.jpg']","['Carnatic Music\n                           \n                               classes', 'Guitar\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Keyboard\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Piano\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Violin\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Vocal Music\n                           \n                               classes', 'Singing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Hindustani Music\n                           \n                               classes', 'Sound Engineering\n                           \n                               classes', 'Audio Engineering\n                           \n                               classes']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/986999-medium190ap.png,"[u'D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinesh Raj\n\n attended \n\n in Aug,2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 15 Oct, 2015\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I joined Grand Harmony a few months ago and loving the fast paced classes here.

Pouring over plenty of advertisements, websites and student testimonials, I made an inquiry with many an established institution.\r\n\r\nAmidst all the running from pillar to post, I stumbled upon Dinesh Sir\'s contact. The one phone-call I made to him is one of the best decisions I have taken in my hitherto journey in music. Though I have been listening to thousands of songs across the last couple of decades, the Audio Engineering course in DYNAMICS School gave me an entirely different perspective to music, both from listening and mixing perspectives.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I had an added restriction that I work in the corporate, and weekends are hence the only time slots I get to further my interest in music. I was highly fortunate that Sir readily agreed to starting off a weekend batch to accommodate the interests of people like me. Though classes were designated for three hours each on Saturday and Sunday, I don\'t remember a single instance where the class was wound up prior to at least four hours! Also, the course started off right from ""What is sound?"", which was the introductory topic in our Physics textbooks of the 9th Standard at school, practical assignments flowed in next. Audio mixing assignments for film trailers and songs made me learn either art to perfection. As I pen down my experience seated in the very class I have been learning for the last several months, I pause to reflect that the atmosphere has never felt like school, but more like home away from home. For, the sessions here are never academic. They are conversational, and there is a flow to every lesson being taught. Visits to nearby audio studios, getting to talk with experts who are involved in professional mixing, getting to know Sir\'s own experiences from his working in the industry, for over a decade,make this school a treasure trove of knowledge. Conveying a \'note of thanks\' is the least I could do, for all the above.?\r\n\t\t\t\t""', u'T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThamizharasan Sekar\n\n attended \n\n in Dec,2014\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 15 Dec, 2014\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I am happy and proud that am one among sound engineers,where I have worked couple of feature film from scratch to Big screens .Without his guidance this could not be made! \r\nMy dream of being an audio engineer has been came through Mr.Dinesh Ramalingam who has given me all the necessary inputs and workouts.\r\nWant to be an Audio Engineer.Come and learn we are here to help!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbishek Dharshan\n\n attended \n\n in Oct,2013\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 14 Dec, 2014\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""The joining of Dynamics School of Audio Engineering is the best decision I ever made.

World class knowledge and a very dynamic thought process environment has now led me to be someone I always wanted to be. I run a full fledged audio recording studio in New Delhi, India, called ""Arcube Records"", and have worked for many big brands because of my audio production quality. If it was not for Sir, I would have never known this side of the field. I am forever grateful to Sir for all the brilliant lectures and amazing concepts. Things that people generally do not share because they have spent years to achieve it, Dinesh Sir would give it right away, as he always believed in us just the same as we did. To know about someone at once and recognise what he or she can do, needs a lot of knowledge, however it came naturally to Dinesh Sir!

I was little apprehensive about the teacher, but Sridevi ma\'am was just too good for a teacher. Ma\'am is very friendly and she showered us with all the technicalities of terracotta jewellery making. With the kind of interest she shows in teaching anyone would want to learn more and more. Not only did we make stuff in class, ma\'am inspired us to do a lot in our free time. We got small home works too. Which kept us busy and involved in the activity. Also many designs were sent to us periodically for ideas. \r\n\r\nI joined to the class on the pretext that I will have a change from just research. But this class gave me much more than I expected. A fantastic proficient and  a jovial teacher to learn from, I think it was one of the best craft classes I ever attended. And I am pretty sure that I can make this a living any time i get bored with my technical life.

Murthy\'s way of teaching was really effective, he avoided the conventional way of running PPT\'s throughout the class.  He had his own style of giving an introduction on a particular topic and explaining things from the console which was very useful to know things practically. He made sure I understand every detail and never hesitated to repeat things when I ask for. He was available without any excuse whenever I had doubts, any time. Very dedicated, I should say. He even extended his help in preparing my resume, which I found very helpful. The way he takes individual care towards his students, evidently shows his passion towards what he is doing.

She is typically honest and very flexible yet thoroughly professional human being.

Her knowledge of the subject, unique style and methodology has remained unmatched till date. She is sincere and has always given a lot of importance to audience feedback. People who have attended her training will always remember her as the trainer who added value to their skills. Even the most senior audiences would admit that they have learnt something new through her programs. I can guarantee that she would be an asset to any company that she is a part of.""""']"

When she told me I could score a perfect 170, I thought she was joking. But she was serious and helped me patiently all the way in achieving that. I had a short time to prepare for the exam and so I registered for a one-on-one crash course. All she needed was a month to get the best out of me. I still remember the day before my exam when I was all by myself in Chennai unable to sleep. I called her and told her I was really scared. It was like 11 in the night. She took the time to talk to me and told me everything was going to be fine and gave me lots of hope. I most definitely couldn\'t have done it without her support.

At the end of the session, I wanted to shift from biology to languages! I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot simultaneously. Sir really made those classes count and I find it really easy to pick up the language after coming here and don\'t find the language to be a barrier at all. I got to practice spoken German and was exposed to various day to day conversations. His command over the language is amazing and he has really inspired me to consider studying languages in greater depth. His teaching methods really help reinforce the basic nuances of the language. As someone who has studied and worked in Germany, sir was able to give me a lot of insights about the country as well. Thank you Sir for your help. I had a lot of fun learning German and continuing this is Germany.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"
