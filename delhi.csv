Here the fees was very less and class structure is limited, so we were free to express our doubts. I hope I will get good grade in my first semester.

EBEES Infotrain Consultancy Services Pvt. Ltd.,,Janakpuri,Delhi,India,110058,"EBEES Info Train Consultancy Services Pvt Ltd started its journey in 2008 and became private limited in 2011. We started as a project management and design training organization. We recognized the requirement of growing need of professionals in the field of animation, online marketing, automation, robotics, analytics' & embedded. This propelled our thought to start courses in these fields. The idea was to churn more professional in these field to meet the growing demand of industry. We have worked in the field of project management, where we have managed projects from domain like airport, highways, roads & buildings. We diversified in the field of construction, in which we started taking construction projects such as civil construction works for buildings and metro. This was our conscious effort, so that our company should not focus only on training but on implementation of design, project management and IT.

I have interviewed with about 5 companies & hardly got 2-3 questions which were not covered in syllabus.\r\n3. 24*7 assistance: Actually it is not 24*7 assistance at all, but whenever I called or drop a message to trainer, I got response very shortly. \r\n4. Job recommendations: I am getting regular updates regarding the job vacancies & other related information through Email & Whats-app.\r\n5. Competitive Fee: Fee is last but not least factor.

The best part, they trained the same art with the initial motive of weight loss and fitness training. I joined his clases. He turned out to be the best Trainer. Being an ex-Army Official, he has learnt Krava Maga all throughout his career. I can say he is the best because I searched a lot about the same on internet and then gave it a try.

We were showed a number of ways to defend ourselves depending on which approach the attacker took, and demonstrated how we could use our timings and techniques, not necessarily just our strength, to our advantage.

Earlier, I started teaching to earn more pocket money, however, it became a passion for me and I focused on teaching mathematics to all classes since maths being my strongest subjects. In graduation, I joined a group with my friends where we used to teach science, statistics, mathematics, accounts and economics. Though I was a science student, I learnt accounts on my own with little help from my friends and started teaching partnership etc. to junior classes. During these years, I was quite famous for teaching and got quite busy. Then I joined MCA and there I used to take classes of my classmates and B. Tech students, even my Computer lecturer used to identify me to take some of C, testing etc. lectures in the college. I was picked in the industry direct from campus and then during my last 18 years, I have acted as mentors to so many staff, took a number of technology sessions, management sessions, PMP, ITIL, Agile sessions and have been involved in trainer evaluation as well.

She works on designing a custom strategic plan for each one of the student that comes to her. In the introductory class itself she discussed about my work, learned about my expectations, my current skills and then we identified the areas that needed to be worked upon. In all our sessions she worked on my fluency and on my business communication skills which was actually what I wanted. \r\nOne thing which everyone will notice of her, is her sense of humour. Students of all age groups and backgrounds come, they laugh, have a good time and don\'t realize what learning they take away with them.

I feel that basics are like if you do not know  alphabets then how  will you write your  name in English  or same in Hindi without knowing varnmala you will not be able to write your name in Hindi as well. First of all i teach basics as SA re Ga ma and Do re mi fa. In different manners .If a student wants to learn but not tuned by God i can make the student sing with regular practices. I love to talk about nature, yoga, physical fitness, dancing with joy, meditation, cooking, spirituality.  I have taught from 4 years baby to years children in schools  and 66 years old ladies also had fun learning with all of them  . While teaching i have to go beyond  with them.

After completion of my Master Degree I started teaching in school as a part time teacher. When I was studying in University I was teaching my juniors. I started my teaching in 2008 as a teacher. I did master's in sculpture. I love to teach Sculpture as well as Drawing & Painting. Carving, Clay Modelling, Sketching, Watercolour, Landscape, Calligraphy etc. these are my favourite medium and topic. I taught primary students to master degree student. I love to teach senior student who can understand and respond positive. I need to discuss a lot for the art development. As a teacher I got a lot of idea from students during discussion. Student learned and got good marks a lot of awards and scholarship etc. I use projector to show ppt and video.","['https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/15794-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/19624-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/19628-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/19629-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/19630-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/19631-large.jpg', 'https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/photo/24204-large.jpg']","['Drawing\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Painting\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Clay Modeling\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Sketching\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Calligraphy\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Handwriting\n                           \n                               classes', 'Craft\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Fine Arts\n                           \n                               Classes']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/799687-medium190.jpg,[]

The faculties go out of their way to help the students, with extra information about all architecture colleges under NATA, their ranking in terms of better education, infrastructure and placements, they tell us about the history of architecture and various other information during the class which is helpful for further reference. I think iMADE has a different approach towards its students. The classes are not the same as any other regular coaching. They make sure all its students are attended in a class of 10 students. They keep it a small batch to give extra attention to each and every one of us. It was overall a exceptionally enriching experience with a new perspective towards the architecture career that I am taking with me.

Goes through reference books before the class and gives a in-depth teaching of the subject matter. Makes sure the students get the concepts by asking them to attempt to come up with real world application code(programs). Makes the class very interesting. His way of teaching got me interested in computer science, a subject I formerly hated. Has a very pragmatic approach in the way he teaches and what he teaches, very very patient as well. One of the best teachers ever and I kid you not. When I explain to others why I choose computer science as my major I narrate to  them my experience with Sir. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would recommend him by a 20 and I am not even exaggerating. You would be really lucky or blessed rather to have sir teach you.""']"

Formerly, I was completely self-taught. Never touched Excel until I took my first job three years ago out of college. I learned how to write formulas, use keyboard short cuts, and dabble with charts, etc, but it took a while and it was painful. Before this class I had stalled in how much I was able to pick up on my own, too; I was no longer just stumbling over new functionality like I had done previously. These 4 weeks have taught me more than in 3 years of working on my own. Even things I knew (IF, VLOOKUP, Conditional Formatting, cell formatting, etc) I know far better now.\r\n\r\nThe best thing I learned from this class, however, is how important presentation is. Crafting spreadsheets with both function AND presentation in mind has made me a far better worker. Taking the extra time to improve data organization, formatting, etc. has seriously paid off. Several colleagues and managers have even commented on how much better my work is, too!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"
