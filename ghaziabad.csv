As I also taught my younger sister am also confident in teaching class 11-12 Biology.I try to simplify complex things, and use simple fundas to explain complex things , which you call ""moti baat"". I drop down to the level of the student and make his concepts clear. My approach is conceptual, mugging up things like parrot is not my cup of tea.I love to teach advanced biology, like Genetics, molecular biology, Bioinformatics(my M.Sc field) etc.I also love teaching science and maths to students of 6th standard to 10th standard,and 11-12 biology is my all time favorite.I have been always complemented for my teaching skills, rest you may decide when you see me teach, sometimes I feel, am born to teach.",[],"['BSc Tuition', 'Medical Entrance Coaching\n                           \n                               classes', 'Class I-V Tuition', 'Class VI-VIII Tuition', 'C Language\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Perl Training\n                           \n                               classes', 'Bioinformatics\n                           \n                               Training']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/463624-medium190.jpg,[]

Aayush,English,Crossing Republik,Ghaziabad,India,201016,iam a b.tech student and i love teaching students so i give tuition to primary class students so that they excel in their studies. As iam short of time so i dont give tuition to senior students.i also work on english of students so that they speak fluent english and i give motivational lectures too.all this will increase the intellectual level of any student which is very important in one's life.so if anyone who is interested in making their children future bright may contact me on my phone no. and they will get all details . i give home tuitions to students to save their time  and they will feel good at their home. moreover im really friendly with my students because a student should feel a friend is teaching them otherwise there will be no difference between school and tuition and most of students don't ask question because they fear from their teachers. A teacher should motivate their students equally and should also teach them about good or bad things in their life.,[],['B Ed Tuition'],https://c.urbanpro.com/assets/new-ui/provider-male-200X200-3c338370173be7fb2ec739d05b5fe4cd.png,[]
