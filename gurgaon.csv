It was literally very easy to locate and find expert with UrbanPro of any field.\r\n-I got Saurabh Gupta sir as the AngularJS expert and when I explained my project, doubts, problems, issues, he answered in a way which blew my mind on the very first day itself. Though it was very tough challenge for me but he converted everything in simplest form. What I admire most about him is his confidence, problem solving ability and never ending support to his students.\r\n-He believes in actually helping people, not just sake of words but actually helps in a way which boosts the confidence of his student and solve your query until you get solution.\r\n-He possess in depth knowledge of AngularJS and for me, he solved all my problems that can only be done by an expert in that field.\r\n-Wait but he equally possess knowledge in other fields as well ( like .NET all concepts). I have already enrolled for full end to end knowledge sharing from Saurabh sir that includes AngularJS, Linq, HTML, CSS, wcf,  Javascript etc.\r\n-I would request everyone who is looking for kick start of these areas or any other, having trouble in understanding concepts and issues in existing project, not able to solve problem, stuck at some failure, feel free to get in touch with Saurabh Sir, he will be the best to solve all queries. I have immense respect for him as you will have also the same feeling when you get in touch with him.Best teacher/expert/friend/mentor I have ever seen. Thanks a ton Saurabh sir. Wish you all the best for tireless effort to help students and raising students from dependent to independent expert in that field. You will become independent expert in your technology as soon as you get in touch with Saurabh Sir.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

They provide you with a coaching of all subjects under one roof and make learning very easy. Their focus is not on making you mug up just for the sake of the examination but to clear the concepts from the very basics. Since the batch size very small as compared to other coaching classes in the market, you get all the personalized attention which you need. This is probably the only coaching class where 2-3 Mock test series are conducted which helps you identify your status and work upon your weaknesses. This also implies that the syllabus is completed well in time giving you enough time for self study and revision which is most important for this course. Suresh Sir motivates you so much that studies don\'t feel like a burden. I could manage to pass my IPCC (both groups) in my first attempt only because of Suresh Sir. When they say they will adopt the student, they mean it in every sense possible. I would highly recommend Straight Shot CA to everyone who want to become a CA in one sure shot attempt.

I have my own ways to learn things and make my students learn those too so that it becomes easy for students to score well. I love mathematics and Statistics and every time i teach these subjects my students always appreciate the way i make this look easy for them. As a teacher i dealt with various type of students ( varying from weaker to intelligent one) and i always come up with the best results as i know how to deal with what kind of student. i use to take exam after each topic completed which helps me to know that what else remains for a student to learn about that topic. and the best thing about my teaching that student need to remember less and understand much more. as understanding makes you to score 100, not just remembering the things.",[],"['BA Tuition', 'BSc Tuition', 'BCom Tuition', 'Class XI-XII Tuition (PUC)', 'BBA Tuition', 'BCA Tuition']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/1014016-medium190.jpg,"[u'U\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUday Sharma\n\n attended \n\n posted on 14 Feb, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""He is a great  teacher, understands the situation of the students whether they are understanding or not does not waste any time in taking extra classes he completes the syllabus on time and even takes care of the revisions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"
