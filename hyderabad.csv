I have been to other tutors but didn\'t experience the depth of knowledge he possess, I personally feel to keep in touch with Divi as long as my career sustains in Abinitio, not for personal gaining of the subject but the motivation which he delivers at those times of hardships in career. \r\n\r\nReally a worthy tutor if you are intending to build your career in this field.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalini Raj\n\n attended \n\n posted on 18 Jun, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I had a training from Divi sir through BigClasses, He is a excellent trainer.

The derivation of how the formulas resolve to as opposed to relying on the software makes DataLabs training unique from other training centers that I have pursued. It laid the foundation to do the Math without the need of software to hand. At the same time, an equal amount of effort was made to emphasize the need of the software. The real-time examples and the exercises on a daily basis helps the students apply the concepts as the training progresses. His openness and sense of humor connects the students to the instructor and make the classes lively. His enthusiasm to do the justice for the time & energy and the perks being paid towards the training makes me strongly recommend DataLabs for your Data Sciences training.

Everything is so perfectly presented that you can\'t ask for anything better.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of them:\r\n\r\n1) Structured course content and good enough topics covered\r\n2) Excellent teaching methodology (NO PPT walk through\'s ) First theory/basic concept on white board, followed by mathematical part and then application of concept to a real time problem\r\n3) I never felt it as online as the sessions were so interactive. Lot of questions posed to students, need to solve assignments. Keeps you on toes \r\n4) Topics are presented covering these basic questions Why, How, Where, When ?\r\n5) Time is never a constraint.

Talenttree Institute For Placement Skills,,APHB Colony,Hyderabad,India,500072,"Career building is a challenging journey. The priceless ingredients are command over the language, fluency, and ability to listen, understand and ask the right questions. Now this means for many of us in India learning a foreign language called ENGLISH. That is not difficult so long one has an attitude and zeal to believe that this is important and can be done. Add to this need of having the English language asset, the relevance of possessing the right aptitude and the requisite soft skills to attend interviews, participate in group discussions, or even grow within an organization with an enviable repertoire of people skills. This undoubtedly is a challenging journey and a multi faceted one. Our vision is to help India and Indians in this. Perhaps herein lies our genesis.

And to all who are skeptical it works just fine. Laxminarayana may use WizIQ or Skype - either works great. He shares his screen online with you and the video is pretty clear.He may use a paint workbook which acts as a whiteboard.\r\n\r\nI was approached by multiple tutors but I chose Laxminarayana, because of the good few years of experience in teaching he has. Another reason I chose him was he seemed passionate about teaching while others offered commercial hour based/ no. of classes based packages - he proposed a result based approach.He mentioned the classes will go on till I get the level of proficiency I desire.\r\n\r\nNow about his teaching style - His pace is ideal, and he can explain well. He clarifies doubts then and there.He revises the previous classes and gives simple assignments at the end of the class. He slowly built up the complexity of topics - spending lot of time on foundation - which I think is the best way to go about the teaching.\r\n\r\nHe keeps testing you on previous concepts and shares good notes at the end of every class. I m pretty happy recommending him as a tutor - because he knows his stuff, and he can explain it well.Cheers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVishvendradeepak B\n\n attended \n\n posted on 04 Feb, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""He is an excellent tutor\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

The unique part about his teaching style is first he understands where exactly the student stands in terms of the technical capabilities and the confidence. Then he plans the training accordingly by focusing more on hands on experience. This will enable the student become more independent if he/she is assigned to a project. He works very hard and expects the same commitment from the students. He is a honest, punctual, passionate and dedicated tutor. My suggestion to aspiring students is take it very serious if want to take the training from Pradeep because he will not bear the students with no commitment. I wish Pradeep all the very best and help the students who are planning to transform their careers in automation testing.

There are so many shades to a human beings behaviour and they come from the different cultural, ethical and different beliefs and backgrounds. And each and everyone has their own philosophy according to their understanding of the things and the way they perceive the things. Here I got an in-depth knowledge of all the things which lead to particular philosophy by a particular person and the way we should understand instead of contradicting.I recommend even others to utilize this and make their lives little more interesting and understanding the colleague s and their philosophies and getting along with life. These are very important as the parents have to teach their children the right things as they later on build their philosophies based on what they have learnt and observed from childhood. So it\'s important that parents get a proper understanding of the things so that they can apply those when the child is growing up and they can build a better understanding child and the way he or she should perceive the things and build their philosophies.Thanks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSahajaahh\n\n attended \n\n posted on 20 Oct, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""It was good.

I generally try to correlate my topics with the current incidents and events so as to enjoy the topic from both the ends. I like to clarify the doubts in a much detailed manner if I haste at times. Biotechnology , Zoology are the most interesting topics of mine. As being in UK I am even good at taking English sessions too.

Lately I was associated with NIFT as an assistant professor. Teaching is a passion for me. I believe in imparting and gaining from other every moment. I dont believe in the traditional method of teaching. It can be much more fun, yet easier to understand. English has always been my first love... followed by design. Most of the times I teach on Powerpoint, because visuals give a better understanding. the age group is not a constraint, because if I know to teach, I can handle any age group.",[],"['Cooking\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Fashion\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Photography\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Spoken English\n                           \n                               classes', 'Hindi Language\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Class IX-X Tuition', 'Class I-V Tuition', 'Makeup\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Beauty and Style\n                           \n                               classes', 'NID Coaching\n                           \n                               classes', 'Fashion Designing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Craft\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Nursery-KG Tuition', 'Adobe Indesign\n                           \n                               Training', 'College Essay Writing \n                           \n                               Providers']",https://c.urbanpro.com/assets/new-ui/provider-female-200X200-4f01def0197ff3f4437cabdafea04864.png,[]
