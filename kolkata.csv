He was in really bad shape when I started with him and even though he is quiet old, he still had a lot of immaturity and did not understand his priorities. His marks were poor mainly English ans Science. But we lot of hardwork and efforts he has finally scored a high percentile in his ICSE. I mainly love biology, physics and maths. Chemistry though not my favorite I can also teach upto XII level. As a teacher I am a calm and no-non sense kind of a person. I scarcely appear as strict but only when matters are really out of hand. I am against corporal punishment and believe it helps in no way.

You inspired me to be a better person, with every class being so full of love and passion. It?s all those little things you did for us, scolding us when we did not perform to our potential, laughing with us-even though our jokes made no sense, treating us with so much respect, and so so SO much more. sir, you have no idea how much those few months of being your student has impacted my life. I don?t think I will ever meet anyone as selfless, or as impacting as you. This is too short a space for me to express how much of a change you have made in me, but I?d like to thank you from the very bottom of my heart, for helping me overcome what I felt was the biggest drawback in me.

Craftsman India,,Bidhan Sarani,Kolkata,India,700006,"Glass painting is not merely about doing outlines and filling it with colors. You need not to pay money for that. You can easily find tutorials on many sites for this purpose. But glass painting is more than that which you will not find in any websites. There are many techniques which you need to know if you want to do it perfectly. If you really want to explore that, if you want to become a professional and earn money, if you love to work with perfection, it is the right kind of place for you.

That was the beginning. Since then, I've taught students from various Boards, Schools, Colleges, mediums, classes etc. The biggest satisfaction I get by teaching is the feedback & confidence of my students about answering all types of questions including the critical & in depth ones, after completing the courses. While teaching students, I get the touch to the basics of the subjects & thus getting an opportunity to sharpen my teaching skills & moreover, to enrich my knowledge about them. As an Engineering Student, I'm getting a lot of help from it besides getting the financial benefit. Maths & Physics are my favourites.

I had a friendly connection with my students since our age difference was lesser and I could feel what exactly they were going through. I loved teaching subjects like psychology, organizational behaviour and marketing the most since these subjects can often be explained with personal experiences. Then I used to keep in touch with my students via mails, facebook and whatsapp, so I was like always available for them. My biggest accomplishment was when all of my students scored above 70 in organizational behaviour (final semester), while prior to that year three students of the earlier batch had backlogs in that paper.

They have great mentors Like Mr Sadi, Mr. Michael and Ms. Mehvash. The best part about EduAims is that they give individualised training to each student. The Prep classes for SAT and TOEFL which I took were brilliant and it helped me a lot. I applied to many Universities and was selected in almost all of them.

The counsellors at Eduaims helped me at every stage of the process including preparations for GRE and TOEFL, shortlisting universities according to my profile, filling up the applications and preparing for the visa interview. What?s special and unique about Eduaims is the personal attention and time they invest towards each individual student. Sadi and Michael are the most accommodating and helpful bunch of people I?ve come across in my life, attending my phone calls at odd hours and providing any support I needed, always with a smile on their face.
