She is a very dedicated and sincere teacher. I remember practicing extra letters and exercises in french and sending it to her through whatsapp, without checking if it was day or night but she always took the pain to correct it. I also loved that she didn\'t make it very serious and hectic for us students. Since I was learning french from her, it was very interesting when she shared things she knew about France and the experiences her students had who visited France. Like any ideal teacher she gives everything her all and so she concentrated on every detail while teaching me french no matter whether it was the pronunciation or spelling or anything. She is an amazing teacher and I would love to finish all of my levels with her . And what else can I say. She makes learning fun!!!!!!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhea Arya\n\n attended \n\n posted on 22 Sep, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""I was a novice to the language and wanted to learn it just for the love and fascination I hold for cultures and languages across the globe and I couldn\'t have got a better teacher than Neha Mam! She kept taking revision as and when possible. When the exam dates neared I didn\'t think I would make it but after the  lovely paper I wrote, I was awed at how vigorously I was trained!

He often says hands-on experience, by that he actually means Hands on your lap because all the students gather around one monitor WATCH what faculty is teaching. Its actually an advertising agency with course demonstration in the form of slides and snap shots in the name of teaching. people who themselves don\'t have job or about to retire work as faculty over here. On the name of course completion certificate which he calls as internship certificate, you\'ll be given a A4 size printout on xerox paper. In the name of class notes you\'ll be asked to get it on your own expense by coordinating with faculty. Classes is like train coaches with upper and lower berth and one common filthy bathroom reserved for faculty. Your importance will depend on your fee\'s payment. if there is delay in payment you will not be allowed to enter classes. you\'ll be charged per day like a lodge. your batch timing will get gradually replaced by  new batches or with the time that he wakes up.

This made me confident for appearing for so called tough exams. Madame is not only very good tutor but an excellent mentor too. The environment she creates in the class was very conducive to bring out the latent talent, which I believe is there in every individual in some form of the other. She is open to new ideas and always ready to solve all queries. \r\n\r\nJust to give a back ground, I am an Engineer and working in Information technology services. I realized that after spending few years  in corporate life, its desire to have overall process view and knowledge of accounting ,costing and Indirect taxes especially when you are working in a consulting area. So I decided to peruse CMA .Now the question was in mind ? where to start? ? from fundamentals like debit and credit ? When I had all these doubts in mind, I came across Bhavani Madame. After I had a brief talk with her about my background, she  encouraged to me to peruse my dream. It is only because of her continuous encouragement which constantly motivated me to work towards my dream. Madame has played a instrumental role in acquiring CMA degree. It has been a great experience.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, every student works hard to get CMA/CA or another professional degree .The key point is, the teaching and mentoring you have undergone which helps you to face the volatile situation of exams. A dedicated and disciplined student would do well anywhere ? but Bhavani Madame helps to bring out the best in each student and that\'s the key differentiator.\r\n\r\nLastly, to all aspirants, whether it is CMA title or another dream, dreaming has five stages (according to Sir RB Savella): First is finding the dream. In our childhood days, we think of what we will become when we grow up. Second: Testing it. We go to school to learn how to do it. Third: Fulfilling that dream. We get to work to make it a reality. Fourth: Improving it. We seek continuing learning and growth. Fifth: Sharing the dream.

The faculties are well trained and have expertise in their particular field of study. Their training methods are comparable with that of British Council English training. During the training sessions for speaking the students are encouraged to participate in the classroom discussions. \r\nMock Tests practice: After completing the training course sessions, they also conduct series of the mock test sessions in order to prepare the students for actual tests. The students are allowed to sit in the class to practice mock tests in the class till they appear for their final exams. \r\nA highly professional training class which I would recommend to all IELTS aspirants to attend before taking any IELTS test.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""', u'S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShikha Singh\n\n attended \n\n posted on 15 Apr, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""\r\n\tTutor jar is one of the best teaching institute for upsc classes .

We would end up getting feedback about our performance depending on their likes and dislikes. In the end had to read few books by self only to realize that what we read previously was entirely wrong.

After that the faculty did so much hard work to train us . They found out the weak points in me and improved it considerably. It was their hard work that led to my selection.

He is practical in approach, patient and very supportive. In the 4 months that I am training under him, I am feeling physically fit and more agile, mentally at peace as he also introduces Yoga exercise to calm down after the Eskrima workouts. I suffer from High BP but this regime under Harshad Sir really has helped me being at peace. I have also lost some excess fat and feel much energetic than before. I would never have done JAL NETI and NETRA NETI on my own but Harshad Sir\'s presence made me do it very easily and have repeated it many times since. I find both these techniques very beneficial. He is also very knowledgeable in Yoga. I strongly recommend Harshad Sir to all those who want to learn Yoga, Boxing, Kick boxing, Eskrima.

This curiosity led me to experiment and start teaching since I was in class XI . Although the classes weren't held in professional manner that time but i learnt many things which have helped me understand different mindsets of people and how different words/actions/objects motivate different people to accomplish any task. I have been teaching for 4 years. The best part that I love about is that I get the ability to make a positive and big difference in someone's life and while teaching , I myself learn a lot from the students. My teaching style varies from course to course and person to person. I focus more on the process rather than on xyz targets. I believe in positive motivation and inspiring people to achieve their pre-determined goals. I tell students to interact as teaching is 2-way process.I love each and every subject that i expertise because every subject is beautiful and useful in its own way. I have taught in NGOs , schools and coaching classes and realised the importance of education. I have come to the understanding that we all are into  a program which i call as '' LIFE LONG LEARNING PROGRAM "" . I was awarded the best upcoming teacher in my school.

But still I am writing here because I want to say Thanks to Naadbramha Sangeet Kalamanch.\r\nI joined Naadbramha before a year after inspiring by their one of the stage concert which they performed at Bhakti Gyan Marg Sadhan Santha, Dahisar East on the occasion of Datta Jayanti. I impressed on their team of artist like Flue Player, Tabla, Pakhawaz and hosting of programme(Nivedan) etc... Really it was good set.\r\nEspecially, I listened Nilesh Sir in that concert which was memorable for me forever. He is having sweet melodious voice. God has gifted him this quality of voice to sing devotional songs. He performed Raag-Bhimpalasi, Raag-Kalavati, Raag- Puriya, Raag- Malkauns and Raag- Bhairavi etc. I was just connected with god while listening his singing. He is a really versatile singer of Kirana Gharana. Anybody can find same concert on YOUTUBE by putting his name. \r\nNilesh Sir is a Chairperson of Naadbramha Sangeet Kalamanch and he directs all  the activities of Naadbramha.  He teach Vocal Classical by own with keeping lot of patience and dedication while teaching to fresh disciples also. Even though this is not Bread n Butter for him. He is highly qualified and working with leading MNC on very senior position.  \r\nI learnt so many things about vocal music under his guidance. I attended his lot of concerts  till date. Especially, one thing I liked about Naadbramha is that everybody is working in Team. All disciples are dedicated for one responsibility at least. They learn, deserve and enjoy while learning Music. \r\nFinally, Naadbramha is simply awesome. I left few months back because I migrated in Canada for Job but I will never forget all these Naadbramha Days.\r\nHeartiest Thanks to Dearest Nilesh Sir..

Nilesh Sir was not ready to give me admission after listening my such a rude voice. After my humble request he allowed me to be with him but not as a disciple. But I decided to give him company and service during his events and concerts. I used to lift instruments while travelling for any concert. After few months he taught me to set Tanpura.That was my real entry in Naadbramha as a Disciple of Nilesh Sir.I was so happy on that day. After six months he started to teach me Sargam. I started practice honestly but my voice was so heavy. But within a year he modulated my voice and brought me up to the learning level. Today I have completed 9 years in Naadbramha.Till date I am learning classing singing under him. I think this birth will not be enough to grasp even one percent talent of Nilesh Sir.Today I can proudly say that I am the disciple of Raigad Bhushan-Sangeet Visharad Mr. Nilesh Mhatre. He is graded artist of Mumbai Akashwani and Doordarshan. He give me opportunity to sing with him in concerts which is my real receipt of his satisfaction what I have learnt since last 9 years. \r\n\r\nActually, I am not liable to speak about such a respected person like Nilesh Sir.But I want to speak about his some special qualities. By qualification he is BE (Mechanical Engineering) + MBA (Operations Management) and steering the entire India Operations of leading MNC as a Operations Head. He has struggled well to learn classical music. Being a human being, he is a very royal person and very cooperative nature he has. Really inspirational personality and possesses polite nature.His family is also too good. Sir treat me as a family member only. He balances his professional, musical and family life very well.\r\n\r\nNilesh Sir is good classical vocalist. He sing Khyal, Bandish, Folk, Semi-Classical, Abhangas  Natyageet etc. God has gifted him such a devotional melodious voice hence devotional songs are specialty of his singing. He is quit young, dynamic and energetic artist.\r\n\r\nThere are lot of albums published in a market in his voice. Narayani Namostute is a super duper hit title of the same.I suggest everybody to have an opportunity to learn music by Nilesh Sir and have a blessings of such a successful person. His teaching method is very friendly and effective.\r\n\r\nSo join Naadbramha  and be a star of music world within a year.. \r\n\r\nThanks to Naadbramha.Thanks to Nilesh Sir.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

Psychology is less of a subject and more of home coming for me. I took to the subject like fish to water and although at school level I was always moderately average, at collage level I was topping. Consequently doing my masters was not a big surprise. But my passion for the subject did not end there. I was intrigued with consumer psychology and research methods and since at that time there was no direct course that offered an understanding for both I decided to pursue them separately finishing a Diploma, A second masters and a Certificate program to get all my skills in place. Then I worked for 8 years as a research executive in a market research organisation and then led a successful business for 8 years. Then there was some dormant phase when other duties took priority. Recently a cousins daughter has taken the same liking and was finding the collage teachers teaching method very dry and boring. When she asked me if I would teach her,  I jumped at the proposal and have been teaching her and her friends since the last few months. Teaching them made me realize just how passionate I am about this subject.  So I am now ready to get back to my first love. I would love to teach this subject at all levels from 11th grade onward.

Tech-originator is one of them. Initially I was skeptical to enroll for ASP.NET with Tech-originator as its a vast subject and Techoriginator being a newly formed institute, I was not sure whether their teachers had enough experience to teach the subject, but I joined anyways in as they were offering the course for a very reasonable amount compared to other institutes and this was the only institute that could fit my budget. But as I started learning from Techoriginator, my scepticism got addressed as I could really see the quality in their teaching. Having one on one sessions really helped me understand the concepts. They teach things systematically, step by step and are patient enough to stick to a topic until you  are not clear with it. What the best part is that they encourage you to ask them questions and don\'t hesitate at all to clear your doubts. I haven\'t felt this comfortable asking questions anywhere else my in school, college or tutions. Having industry professionals teaching you is a big advantage as they make you practice allot rather than only giving you notes to take home, mug and give exams. Here there is more practical than theory.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"

Teaching is my passion in a way. It helps me feel stress free. I am a tarot card reader also and I have been doing it since the past 8 yrs. I am very cool and frank while teaching. I don't believe in the teacher student relationship. I like to sit with my student and study so that he/she gets the feel of doing group study. This technique helps me to get the best out of the student. The topic that I love the most is Science especially Biology. Biology is just a synonym of my life.

It all started with my plan to go to Germany for my higher education (Master of Business Administration). I took a demo class from 2 teachers, one was so terrible as compared to the other that I had to go with the other one, the one by Mrs Grama, which I think was the best decision. You don`t just get to learn German, you learn a lot about Germany as well, since she has spent a lot of time there. She is flexible with timings and gives equal opportunity to everyone in her class to learn. I would definitely recommend everyone to join her classes. Danke sehr Frau Grama.

She made my life easier with her positive attitude. She used to take debate sessions, writing sessions and all others in an entertaining way such that we find learning much more interesting like never before. She not only teaches but involve herself to the best with the student that they feel so comfortable n confident in what they are doing. Learning before was never easy and interesting till i met her.

Walk_in has designed its curriculum in order to offer students with a host of relevant skills-sets like Sketching, Sculpting, Acting, and Photography which are crucial to succeed as digital artists in the entertainment industries.",[],"['Drawing\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Photography\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Interior Designing\n                           \n                               classes', 'Sketching\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Web Designing\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Adobe Photoshop Training\n                           \n                               classes', 'Graphic Designing\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Animation & Multimedia\n                           \n                               Classes', 'Google SketchUp\n                           \n                               Training', 'Revit Structure\n                           \n                               Training', 'Rhinoceros 3D\n                           \n                               Training', 'NATA Coaching\n                           \n                               Classes']",https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tv-prod/member/photo/1615014-medium190ap.jpg,"[u'A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkit Goda\n\n attended \n\n in Sep,2014\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n posted on 08 Jun, 2016\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t""""I would like to thanks Walk_in Academy N Faculty to bring me at this level N Looking more forward.The Faculty is Super Awesome in all Skills,Management is very cool and good in all way,the Infrastructure is very nice.Technology wise too ahead.

I have joined MIRRA Life Class in 2003 when it began in Andheri East area. That time I was studying Graphic Design at L. S. Raheja School of Art, Bandra. Soon I will be completing 11 years at MIRRA Life Class. During this span I have learnt many precious things of Life as under :\r\n\r\nSUCCESS FORMULA: Mirra Mam conducts MIRRA Life Class which is directed by Prof Mohaan Sir. I graduated in 2005 so for initial two years I got guidance from Sir and Mam to be better student for my college education. Mohaan Sir always tells us about 3H Formula for Success i.e. ?H?ard Work, ?H?ead Work, ?H?eart Work !!! After graduation I have used the formula for beginning and then growth of my career. Now am using it for my Life?\r\n         \r\nCOMMUNICATION SKILLS: Mohhan Sir was invited by L. S. Raheja School of Art, Worli as Viva Examiner during 2001-2005. Sir realised that vernacular medium students lack power of expression in English. And incidentally it is ?The Language? of Advertising Field? I have done my S.S.C. in Marathi medium so Mohaan Sir always encouraged me to speak in English? At MIRRA Life Class once in a month we have a brief Public Speaking session where every student has to participate. This certainly boosted my confidence?\r\n         \r\nCREATIVE THINKING: Mohaan Sir receives ?Creative Ideas? from his students who are professionals now. Sir shows these on computer to the students. We all observe, discuss and try to say some thing. Then Sir elaborates and we jot down? At our class we play a game called ?Imagination Exercise? which is similar to ?Tangram? ? the famous Chinese game. We are encouraged to try new things. Both these interesting activities enriched my ?Creative Thinking? which is a must for Advertising Professional !\r\n         \r\nBETTER LIFE: After graduation I have happily continued with MIRRA Life Class as I have benefited with their many activities for Better Life? Mohaan Sir and Mirra Mam?s definition of Better Life is Happiness, Health, Success, Wealth and Long Life? We all students are very lucky to groom ourselves on these aspects by Sir and Mam. Every session begins with Omkar Chanting, Prayer and listening to Positive Commands recorded in Sir?s kind, assuring & soothing voice? Later the recording is given to us in our cellphone so we can listen at home also? Listen More? Benefit More? \r\n       \r\nGURU ACTIVITY: Mohaan Sir has designed a greeting card for ?GuRu Pournima?. Here the meaning of GuRu is beautifully illustrated, Gu is Darkness? Ru is Light? GuRu takes us from Darkness to Light? We all students are very much grateful to Mohaan Sir and Mirra Mam? for our Wonderful, Beautiful and Blissful Journey from Darkness to Light? We all salute with Devotion Sir and Mam?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t""']"
